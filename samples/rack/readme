rack is a basic framework
a lego alapja

Rack provides a minimal, modular and
adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby. By wrapping
HTTP requests and responses in the
simplest way possible, it unifies
and distills the API for web servers,
web frameworks, and software in between
(the so-called middleware) into a single
method call.
